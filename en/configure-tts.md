# Configure Text-to-speech(TTS)

TimeR Machine's Voice and Countdown behaviors depend on the Text-to-speech function of the phone. Please follow the instruction below to configure it:

1. Go to the system settings, search "Text-to-speech" and click it.
1. Configure the engine, language, and other settings.

    If the engine list has only one "Pico TTS" and the language list doesn't contain your language, you need to install an engine first.

    The Text-to-speech engine can be installed on the phone as an app and will be shown in the engine list after installation. Google Text-to-Speech is one of the most popular TTS engines. Search "Text-to-speech" in the app store, download, and install an engine.

    After installation, go back to the system settings to configure TTS.

1. After configurations, you could go back to TimeR Machine, enter Help&Feedback, select "Text-to-speech Configuration," and test the conversion to make sure it works.
