## Music behavior positioning

It's designed to play short reminded sound and not to handle too many music playback cases. If you wish to listen to some relaxing music, please use a music app.

## Tweak time quickly

After enabling [Advanced Time Tweak] in the app settings, in the timer screen, you can tweak time by just pressing the tweak button, moving the finger to a time and releasing the finger. This is quicker than tapping twice.
